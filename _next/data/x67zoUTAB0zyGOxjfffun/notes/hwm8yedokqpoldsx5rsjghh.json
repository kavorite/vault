It is built from the ground up for conditioning on individual preferences to recommend <em>people</em> to <em>one another</em> by conditioning on associated samples of their content, making it instantly useful for content aggregation and social media applications.</p>\n<!-- \nTODO: my homework \n\nThere's a couple of key reasons that it outperforms baseline ECommerce recommendation systems, not the least of which is described in a rather pithy observation made in the paper: The job of the system is not merely to maximize $P(A|B)$ that user Alice likes user Bob, or $P(B|A)$, the converse. The _objective..._ is to maximize $P(A|B) ∧ P(B|A)$, which is strictly a far rarer event given two geometrically distributed random variables. Interestingly, this makes the instance discrimination objective used to pretrain TIRR's visual discriminator [[far more tractable|ref.cl.supcon]]. -->\n<p>There are many technical extensions and improvements that can be made. For example, it only uses photographs, not natural-language descriptions. The kernel tricks employed by LSTMs and GRUs in order to give them \"long term\" memory by emulating tracing patterns observed in mammalian cognition actually forget rather quickly, making integration of a method such as <a href=\"/vault/notes/gj4j8mv891v6ofxgbv7a3fu\">Structured State Space Sequence Models</a>'s HiPPO potentially somewhat useful, both for condition predictions on longer historical contexts and use convolutions for training in parallel. </p>\n<p>This ordinarily \"catastrophic\" forgetting could, however, be seen as favorable for a temporal model which must rapidly learn to condition new predictions on user preference within one session of use and adapt to changing preferences in real-time: causal autoregression in fixed memory at test-time may be the most important pragmatic consideration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/vault/assets/images/tirr.png\" alt=\"TIRR&#x27;s architecture\"></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"ihfr21mlvz5lp3n62uu344t","title":"kavlogs","desc":"","updated":1659115143090,"created":1659018913792,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"ref","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"41b7e8cfe841b035025dfa85ec0b142e","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["39acu8nb3xn6t18xul0ji8d","jc56h8njgqawadlroex4ju1","wf5gku64lj2ag6n8kzs9o8f","jlbuz8giyj93jsc1l0lmbzs","3c09ct2zvlk9dfitxexbss3"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"This is an assorted collection of notes and thoughts on things I've read about before.
