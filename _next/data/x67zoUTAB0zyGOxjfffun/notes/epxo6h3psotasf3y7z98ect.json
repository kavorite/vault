On multilingual, semi-supervised NMT, state of the art generalization was reported across arbitrary language pairs by applying self-supervised denoising-autoencoder objectives to high-resource language datasets. Their complaint about the \"unscalability\" of data procurement for low-resource languages seems to be openly taking aim at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11125\">M2M100</a>, introduced by Fan, et al., 2020.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Achieving universal translation between all human language pairs is the holy-grail of machine translation (MT) research. While recent progress in massively multilingual MT is one step closer to reaching this goal, it is becoming evident that extending a multilingual MT system simply by training on more parallel data is unscalable, since the availability of labeled data for low-resource and non-English-centric language pairs is forbiddingly limited. To this end, we present a pragmatic approach towards building a multilingual MT model that covers hundreds of languages, <strong>using a mixture of supervised and self-supervised objectives, depending on the data availability for different language pairs.</strong> We demonstrate that the synergy between these two training paradigms enables the model to produce high-quality translations in the <strong>zero-resource setting,</strong> even surpassing supervised translation quality for low- and mid-resource languages. We conduct a wide array of experiments to understand the effect of the degree of multilingual supervision, domain mismatches and amounts of parallel and monolingual data on the quality of our self-supervised multilingual models. To demonstrate the scalability of the approach, we train models with <strong>over 200</strong> languages and demonstrate high performance on zero-resource translation on several previously under-studied languages. We hope our findings will serve as a stepping stone towards enabling translation for the next thousand languages.</p>\n</blockquote>","noteIndex":{"id":"ihfr21mlvz5lp3n62uu344t","title":"kavlogs","desc":"","updated":1659115143090,"created":1659018913792,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"ref","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"41b7e8cfe841b035025dfa85ec0b142e","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["39acu8nb3xn6t18xul0ji8d","jc56h8njgqawadlroex4ju1","wf5gku64lj2ag6n8kzs9o8f","jlbuz8giyj93jsc1l0lmbzs","3c09ct2zvlk9dfitxexbss3"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"This is an assorted collection of notes and thoughts on things I've read about before.
