Most of the publication just talks about jointly training a transformer textual encoder with an image encoder. As seems to be OpenAI's trademark, most of this discussion is making a lot of hay over very little actual novelty in its methods, and is mostly just impressive in its thorough enumeration of implementation details and sheer scale. </p>\n<p>The real meat of the publication lies in the review of a number of different approaches from literature for methods of image synthesis (<a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/papers/dall-e-2.pdf\">paper</a> Section 2, \"Method\"), which reconstruct images by conditioning on both explicit textual prompts and latent multimodal embeddings. This process is not trained jointly with CLIP. Instead, the \"text-image codebook\" is learned ahead of time. <a href=\"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qw8AKxfYbI\">Classifier-free guidance</a> is implemented by randomly dropping CLIP embeddings during UnCLIP's training regime.</p>\n<p>The best confluence of sample diversity, visual fidelity, and aesthetic ratings by human viewers was found to use an ensemble of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502\">DDIM</a> models which feed forward into one another with intermediate steps which upsample to a higher resolution (64×64, 256×256, 1024×1024), although it is unclear from the paper exactly how each stage is parametrized. This three-stage pipeline and the intermediate upsampling steps are collectively called UnCLIP. In this regime, each successive upsampled image is noised essentially by applying a transposed block filter, rather than by directly sampling from a Gaussian distribution. </p>\n<p>Denoising the image via inpainting while reproducing the same semantics as the original content becomes a nontrivial, denoising-autoencoding objective for which diffusion models were found to be best suited overall. Perhaps a decoder could perform better by allowing the upsampling factor to be conditioned on the input using <a href=\"/vault/notes/zy4oqk1z59whxqbjtmwbdm4\">Feature-wise Linear Modulation</a> and dynamically learned?</p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/vault/notes/txmy1anxf7bhr607yyk7te7\">DEQ Extensions (vault)</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"ihfr21mlvz5lp3n62uu344t","title":"kavlogs","desc":"","updated":1659115143090,"created":1659018913792,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"ref","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"41b7e8cfe841b035025dfa85ec0b142e","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["39acu8nb3xn6t18xul0ji8d","jc56h8njgqawadlroex4ju1","wf5gku64lj2ag6n8kzs9o8f","jlbuz8giyj93jsc1l0lmbzs","3c09ct2zvlk9dfitxexbss3"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"This is an assorted collection of notes and thoughts on things I've read about before.
