This section is dedicated to novel deep modules and topologies I've seen being applied and invented recently. I may eventually add some more pedestrian stuff like discrete convolutions, various types of low-rank gated RNNs, etc., but for right now other resources should suffice to get you conceptually up to speed on all of those. This is here for my reference.
